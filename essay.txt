Martial law in 2024

On December 3rd, president Yoon proclaimed martial law. Everyone were surprised and shocked, but it ended only in 6 hours. This time, letâ€™s get to know about martial law that happened on December 3rd!

First, what was I doing when the martial law was proclaimed, and what was my reaction? I was listening to math class on online, and suddenly, my math teacher told me that Yoon proclaimed martial law! So I checked my discord, and everyone was talking about the martial law. After my math class was over, my first reaction was to ask my mom whether I have to go to school tomorrow. But the martial law was not related to war, and was related to politics, so we had to go to school. (I was very disappointed) Other people were very angry that this happened in 2024. However, I just slept well. The next day, I heard the martial law has ended. I was very dumbfounded, but I just went to school normally, and everyone was talking about the martial law happened last night.
Second, what is a martial law, and what does it mean to our country?
